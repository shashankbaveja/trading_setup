# Automated Trading System Implementation

## Project Objective

The primary goal is to develop an automated trading system that:
1.  Fetches real-time data from the Kite API.
2.  Analyzes data based on predefined technical strategies.
3.  Executes and manages trades.

## System Components

The system will be divided into the following main parts:

1.  **Data Preparation**: Involves acquiring, cleaning, and storing market data.
2.  **Signal Generation**: Implements trading strategies to generate buy/sell signals based on technical indicators.
3.  **Trading Loop & Orchestration**:
    *   A central orchestrator script will manage the overall workflow, including fetching new data and triggering trade executions.
    *   **Trading Simulation**: A module to backtest and simulate the performance of trading strategies.
    *   **Trade Execution & Monitoring**: Handles the actual placement of trades via the Kite API and monitors their performance.

The existing `myKiteLib.py` will serve as a foundational library for basic Kite API interactions and other common functionalities.

## Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Daily Options Data Ingestion (Minute Level)**:
    *   Develop a daily loop to run every evening to fetch minute-level options data.
    *   **New Instruments**: Ensure new options instruments are identified and included.
    *   **Data Looping**: Implement a robust loop to fetch data for all relevant options.
    *   **One-Time Backfill**: Perform a one-time data backfill for the last two months.
    *   **Daily Delta**: Modify the loop to fetch data for the last two days on a daily basis.

2.  **Candle Data Resampling Function**:
    *   Create a function within `myKiteLib.py`.
    *   **Input**: Accept an instrument token or a list of tokens.
    *   **Process**: Fetch minute-level candle data from the database for the given token(s).
    *   **Output**: Convert the 1-minute data into 2-minute, 3-minute, 4-minute, 5-minute, and 10-minute intervals and return as a Pandas DataFrame.
