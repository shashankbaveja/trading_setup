I want you to behave like an expert trader who specializes in intraday options trading.
My objective is to build a model to predict short term reversals in the market and take advantage of the same. Short term means 5-10 minute window
We will primarily look at NIFTY50 Index and trade options for it. INDEX NIFTY 50 instrument token = 256265

I want to look at movements (downtrend reversal) in the index and accordingly but call options with clear target price and stop loss. 
I want to build multiple strategies with a lot of technical indicators and predict that reversal on the index and simulate the trading on the option.
